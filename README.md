Repository for Supercollider powered Raspberry Pi programmable portable synthesizer.

Currently very messy and in active development.  Eventually the code base will stablize.  The goal is to create a programmable synth that removes many of the annoyances of getting supercollider set up on a raspberyy pi and the challenges for beginning programmers to write a hardware and software interface for supercollider.  Effectively sandboxing the process of coding synths, samplers, and filters in supercollider. Beginning programmers will be able to quickly create and perform custom insturments while being introduced to the power and flexibility of supercollider.  Advanced programmers will be to use this as a starting point for further development.
